1) basic structure of AFL
-------------------------

- main
    - fuzz_one: mmap test case and mutate it
        - common_fuzz_stuff
            - **save_if_interesting**
    - sync_fuzzers: mmap from queue and call save_if_interesting
        - **save_if_interesting**

2) saving previous seed point
-----------------------------

`save_if_interesting` save intersting things like crash. So we also save `previous input` at this point.
